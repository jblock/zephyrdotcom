		<p class="big-paragraph">Our concept for how to face this challenge is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/prototype">Solace</a>, an environment that seeks to invigorate factory culture through immersive, interactive experiences.</p>
		<p>The project was a part of the 8-month capstone project of the Master of Human-Computer Interaction program at Carnegie Mellon University. Over the duration of the project, our multidisciplinary team executed contextual research at the Everett Manufacturing Facility in Everett, Washington as well as prototyped and tested solutions with factory workers.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, due to the proprietary nature of this project, we cannot display any research findings online.</p>
