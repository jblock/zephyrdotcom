		<p class="first">Our goal is to understand the many layers of interaction within the final assembly process of the 787 Dreamliner and envision a financially viable solution that facilitates efficient communication.</p>
		<p>The project is a part of the 8-month capstone project of the Master of Human-Computer Interaction program at Carnegie Mellon University. Over the duration of the project, our multidisciplinary team will execute contextual research at the Everett Manufacturing Facility in Everett, Washington as well as prototype and test solutions.</p>
		<p>As the project progresses, this website will be updated with information about our research and visioning process. Unfortunately, due to the proprietary nature of this project, we cannot display any research findings online.</p>
