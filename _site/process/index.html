			<h3>Jan 25, 2013</h3>
			<h2>Client Kick-off Meeting</h2>
			<p>On January 25, 2013, Boeing clients flew to our Pittsburgh campus to meet our team and kick start the project. This was the first time we got to meet our clients, and after some quick introductions we went straight to business. We discussed the scope of our project, which was to improve communication in the Everett Factory, and we discussed the needs of Boeing as well as the goals of the HCI Capstone project.</p>

			<h3>Jan - Feb 2013</h3>
			<h2>Literature Review</h2>
			<p>To gain a more detailed understanding of the problem space of factory communication, we reviewed relevant literature. Some resources were academic journals grounded in theoretical solutions to communication and efficiency problems, while others were sourced from magazine articles and industry whitepapers describing success stories. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-module left">
			<h3>Jan - Feb 2013</h3>
			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>We further researched relevant product spaces to broaden our domain knowledge prior to conducting field research at the EMC. We examined processes and tools that enable efficient factory communication in large-scale operations. In particular, we examined integration of factory data with Manufacturing Execution Systems, process improvement methodologies employed in factory settings, and next-generation airplane production paradigms.</p>

			<h3>Feb 2013</h3>
			<h2>Gathering Data</h2>
			<p>We flew to Seattle twice in February to perform research on the factory floor. We interviewed 25 factory floor workers from 12 different roles and attended various meetings.</p>
			<h4>Contextual Interviews and Shadowing</h4>
			<p>Working with contacts in the EMC, we set up on-the-job shadowing with Boeing employees. Our goal was to observe workflow as it occurred naturally, rather than have it described to us. This contextual experience accounts for the fact that someone’s perception or memory of how they do work can be different from what actually happens on the job. People often forget about repetitive and monotonous tasks that may in fact be central to their work. They also might recall an ideal, hypothetical version of a workflow rather than describe the reality of the situation. Contextual observation gave us a clear picture of work is being done at the EMC. </p>
			<h4>Attending IT and Process Improvement Meetings</h4>
			<p>We attended a number of IT events, including Lean and Kaizen meetings, and extensively interviewed IT employees. This gave us an understanding of the factory from the perspective of the people who design and build its products and informed us of various initiatives that have been made to address workers’ needs. </p>
			<h4>Ethnography</h4>
			<p>Since communication was the broad focus of our research, any interaction we observed in the EMC presented a potentially useful insight. From waiting in line at the factory’s coffee shop to watching our participants play ping-pong, we spent time in between interviews observing cultural trends and the factory floor as a whole. Throughout the entire experience, we looked for patterns of interaction and behavior that could inform the rest of our research findings.

			<h3>Feb 2013</h3>
			<h2>Interpretation</h2>
			<p>Once we arrived back in Pittsburgh, we held interpretation sessions to have an organized structure to our notes from our contextual interviews and to make sure everyone in our team knew of each other's interviews. In order to receive the greatest benefit from interviewing, we interpreted our notes from the interviews within 48 hours of their occurrence. This allowed for clearer recollection of facts and details, enriching the accuracy of our data. </p>
			<p>We transmitted the information we learned individually to the group as a whole by telling the stories of our research experiences. The storyteller explained background information in order to form a collective understanding of the data.</p>
			<p>Team members who were not present during the interview probed for more details and tried to understand the deeper motivations of observed behaviors. This led the interviewer to think and reflect on what happened and brought their personal insights to the surface.</p>

			<h3>Feb - Mar 2013</h3>
			<h2>Data Synthesis</h2>
			<h4>Affinity Diagramming</h4>
			<p>We created affinity diagrams of our notes created during our interpretation sessions. The process of affinity diagramming involved the creation of hierarchical categories from detailed data. We created categories on the basis of perceived similarity and connection between individual notes. Unconventional ways of grouping notes were encouraged, so as to interpret information in a way that fostered creative thinking. </p>
			<h4>Cultural Models</h4>
			<p>Creating cultural models helped reveal influences that impact how workers do their jobs. Cultural models visualize the often invisible influences on an individual, such as policies, pressures, and organizational trends. Understanding the culture of the Everett Factory was important for contextualizing and gaining an understanding of workers’ experiences. </p>
			<h4>Flow Models</h4>
			<p>We created flow models to capture the flow of people, actions, information, and artifacts from the perspective of one individual. Generating flow models illustrated successes and breakdowns in communication between workers. They served as visible documentation of a worker’s concrete responsibilities as they were enacted during interviews.</p>
