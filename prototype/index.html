			<h3>What is Solace?</h3>
			<p class="big-paragraph">The workday of a factory employee is strict and regimented. Controlled processes and procedures are pivotal in producing quality airplanes at a large scale. Consequently, the worker often feels small and disconnected. The factory functions as a machine, but the workers are not gears and pinions; they are surgeons and artisans, and most importantly—<strong>people</strong>. </p>
			<p>For them, we have designed Solace: a private, expressive space where people create immersive rooms through <strong>touch</strong>, <strong>motion</strong>, and <strong>speech</strong> interactions. It complements the rigidity of the factory environment by promoting a sense of play and exploration. Solace is the first step in transforming the culture of the factory into a more open and collaborative space—one that fully embraces personal expression, and where workers feel empowered to make an impact on their daily work environment. </p>

			<h3>How it works</h3>
			<h4>Hand and Arm Movements</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5 alpha">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/dragging.jpg">
			<p>Touching and dragging a single hand creates a trail of particles.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/attractive-field.jpg">
			<p>Holding a full hand down on the screen creates a gravity field that attracts the flow of particles nearby, while the background color slowly changes hue.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/expanding.jpg">
			<p>Pinching and expanding two hands pushes or pulls particles radially.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5 omega">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/gust.jpg">
			<p>Waving hands across the screen creates a gust of wind that blows particles in the direction of flow.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_10 alpha omega">
			<h4>Body Movements</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5 alpha">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/jumping-1.jpg">
			<p>Once feet have left the ground, a wave begins to travel upwards and push particles in its path.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/jumping-2.jpg">
			<p>The wave hits its apex at the same time as the jumper reaches their peak.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/jumping-3.jpg">
			<p>As it travels back to the ground, it creates a downwards gust of wind that blows the particles.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid_2_5 omega">
			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/jumping-4.jpg">
			<p>As it hits the ground, the entire canvas shakes and trembles, moving particles with it.</p>

			<h3>Speak Your Mind Room</h3>
			<p>We created a pre-made room that visualizes what people say out loud, altering the words to express the emotion in which the words were spoken. Characteristics of the typeface change based on how the person is speaking or emoting.</p>

		<div class="grid_6">
			<img src="../images/relaxation.jpg" />
			<h3>Relaxation Room</h3>
			<p>To cater to people who preferred a private relaxing environment, we created a room that could allow people to feel calm after experiencing frustration. The visuals in the relaxation room were influenced by fluid motions such as ripples in water and floating bubbles. Various shades of blue color the room, and a relaxing song was chosen to accompany the mood.</p>

			<h3>Concept Imagery</h3>
			<p>In exploring all of the possibilites of Solace, we created conceptual imagery and videos to illustrate the immersive environment we wanted to convey. We used a photo collage and After Effects to create a concept video that contextualizes our product within the factory, so that stakeholders could see its potential impact.</p>
