		<h3>What is Solace?</h3>
		<p>The workday of a factory employee is strict and regimented. Controlled processes and procedures are pivotal in producing quality airplanes at a large scale. Consequently, the worker often feels small and disconnected. The factory functions as a machine, but the workers are not gears and pinions; they are surgeons and artisans, and most importantly—people. </p>
		<p>For them, we have designed Solace: a private, expressive space where people create immersive rooms through touch, motion, and speech interactions. It complements the rigidity of the factory environment by promoting a sense of play and exploration. Solace is the first step in transforming the culture of the factory into a more open and collaborative space—one that fully embraces personal expression, and where workers feel empowered to make an impact on their daily work environment. </p>

			<h3>How it works</h3>
			<h4>Hand and Arm Movements</h4>

			<img class="feature-photo" src="../images/dragging.png">
			<p>Touching and dragging a single hand creates a trail of particles.</p>

			<p>Holding a full hand down on the screen creates a gravity field that attracts the flow of particles nearby, while the background color slowly changes hue.</p>

			<p>Pinching and expanding two hands pushes or pulls particles radially.</p>

			<p>Waving hands across the screen creates a gust of wind that blows particles in the direction of flow.</p>
